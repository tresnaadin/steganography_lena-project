# Goals
The goal of this project is to change the value of the decimal digit which is converted to binary and replace the binary digit with a word or sentence (the number of binary digits used is adjusted to the number of words or input sentences)

## Case Study
On this case study, I'm using an image named "lena512.bmp" and the word I'm using as a input message is a word "Desember"

## Tools
Run it on Matlab apps
https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html

## How to Use
1. Put all this file to same folder
2. Open file lena-lena.m on Matlab
3. Then just run it

## Obstacle
I have no idea how to decrypt the message from this project hahaha. But maybe if you know how to decrypt or show those message from this lena512.bmp, please let me know

## Coder notes
This project has many potential to make it more better, and i'll be glad if you could contribute to it. If you think this little project could be your media to learn about cryptography and sample project for your MatLab, you could freely clone this repo
